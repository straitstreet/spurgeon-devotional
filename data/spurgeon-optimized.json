throughout all generations; she is the cross-bearer after Jesus. Mark then, Christian, Jesus does not suffer so as to exclude your suffering. He bears a cross, not that you may escape it, but that you may endure it. Christ exempts you from sin, but not from sorrow. Remember that, and expect to suffer.\n\n\n    But let us comfort ourselves with this thought, that in our case, as in Simon's, it is not our cross, but Christ's cross which we carry. When you are molested for your piety; when your religion brings the trial of cruel mockings upon you, then remember it is not your cross, it is Christ's cross; and how delightful is it to carry the cross of our Lord Jesus!\n\n\n    You carry the cross after Him. You have blessed company; your path is marked with the footprints of your Lord. The mark of His blood-red shoulder is upon that heavy burden. 'Tis His cross, and He goes before you as a shepherd goes before his sheep. Take up your cross daily, and follow Him.\n\n\n    Do not forget, also, that you bear this cross in partnership. It is the opinion of some that Simon only carried one end of the cross, and not the whole of it. That is very possible; Christ may have carried the heavier part, against the transverse beam, and Simon may have borne the lighter end. Certainly it is so with you; you do but carry the light end of the cross, Christ bore the heavier end.\n\n\n    And remember, though Simon had to bear the cross for a very little while, it gave him lasting honour. Even so the cross we carry is only for a little while at most, and then we shall receive the crown, the glory. Surely we should love the cross, and, instead of shrinking from it, count it very dear, when it works out for us \"a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.\""},"e":{"d":"April 5th","v":185,"t":"Before honour is humility.","c":""}},"04-06":{"m":{"d":"April 6th","v":186,"t":"Let us go forth therefore unto Him without the camp.","c":""},"e":{"d":"April 6th","v":187,"t":"In the name of the Lord I will destroy them.","c":""}},"04-07":{"m":{"d":"April 7th","v":188,"t":"O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame?","c":""},"e":{"d":"April 7th","v":189,"t":"Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, Thou God of my salvation;

Remphan's star shines no longer, and the women weep no more for Tammuz, but Mammon still intrudes his golden calf, and the shrines of pride are not forsaken. Self in various forms struggles to subdue the chosen ones under its dominion, and the flesh sets up its altars wherever it can find space for them. Favourite children are often the cause of much sin in believers; the Lord is grieved when He sees us doting upon them above measure; they will live to be as great a curse to us as Absalom was to David, or they will be taken from us to leave our homes desolate. If Christians desire to grow thorns to stuff their sleepless pillows, let them dote on their dear ones.\n\n\n    It is truly said that \"they are no gods,\" for the objects of our foolish love are very doubtful blessings, the solace which they yield us now is dangerous, and the help which they can give us in the hour of trouble is little indeed. Why, then, are we so bewitched with vanities? We pity the poor heathen who adore a god of stone, and yet worship a god of gold. Where is the vast superiority between a god of flesh and one of wood? The principle, the sin, the folly is the same in either case, only that in ours the crime is more aggravated because we have more light, and sin in the face of it. The heathen bows to a false deity, but the true God he has never known; we commit two evils, inasmuch as we forsake the living God and turn unto idols. May the Lord purge us all from this grievous iniquity!\n\n\n\n    \"The dearest idol I have known,\n     Whate'er that idol be;\n     Help me to tear it from thy throne,\n     And worship only thee.\""},"e":{"d":"May 4th","v":242,"t":"Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible.","c":""}},"05-05":{"m":{"d":"May 5th","v":243,"t":"I will be their God, and they shall be my people.","c":""},"e":{"d":"May 5th","v":244,"t":"He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth in the Lord, happy is he.","c":""}},"05-06":{"m":{"d":"May 6th","v":245,"t":"We dwell in Him.","c":""},"e":{"d":"May 6th","v":246,"t":"All the days of my appointed time will I wait.","c":""}},"05-07":{"m":{"d":"May 7th","v":247,"t":"Great multitudes followed Him, and He healed them all.","c":""},"e":{"d":"May 7th","v":248,"t":"Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.","c":""}},"05-08":{"m":{"d":"May 8th","v":249,"t":"He that was healed wist not who it was.","c":""},"e":{"d":"May 8th","v":250,"t":"Acquaint now thyself with Him.","c":""}},"05-09":{"m":{"d":"May 9th","v":251,"t":"Who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings.","c":""},"e":{"d":"May 9th","v":252,"t":"Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field . . . let us see if the vine flourish.","c":""}},"05-10":{"m":{"d":"May 10th","v":253,"t":"But now is Christ risen from the dead.","c":""},"e":{"d":"May 10th","v":254,"t":"The only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.","c":""}},"05-11":{"m":{"d":"May 11th","v":255,"t":"I am with you alway.","c":""},"e":{"d":"May 11th","v":256,"t":"Only be thou strong and very courageous.","c":""}},"05-12":{"m":{"d":"May 12th","v":257,"t":"And will manifest myself to him.","c":""},"e":{"d":"May 12th","v":258,"t":"Fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation: I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again.","c":""}},"05-13":{"m":{"d":"May 13th","v":259,"t":"Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.","c":""},"e":{"d":"May 13th","v":260,"t":"Thou art my portion, O Lord.","c":""}},"05-14":{"m":{"d":"May 14th","v":261,"t":"Joint heirs with Christ.","c":""},"e":{"d":"May 14th","v":262,"t":"He shall gather the lambs with His arm, and carry them in His bosom.","c":""}},"05-15":{"m":{"d":"May 15th","v":263,"t":"All that believe are justified.","c":""},"e":{"d":"May 15th","v":264,"t":"Made perfect.","c":""}},"05-16":{"m":{"d":"May 16th","v":265,"t":"Who giveth us richly all things to enjoy.","c":""},"e":{"d":"May 16th","v":266,"t":"And he said, Thus saith the Lord, Make this valley full of ditches.
